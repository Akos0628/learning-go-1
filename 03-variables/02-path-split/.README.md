# Read the {{index . "component"}} attribute from a path

Write a small function that utilizes the [`path.Split()` function](https://pkg.go.dev/path#Split) to obtain the {{index . "component"}} part of `{{index . "fullpath"}}` and discard the other component returned by `path.Split()`. Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

The {{index . "component"}} part of `{{index . "fullpath"}}` is `{{index . "output"}}`.
