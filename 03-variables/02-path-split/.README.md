# Read the {{index . "component"}} attribute from a path

Write a small function that utilizes the [`path.Split()` function](https://pkg.go.dev/path#Split)
to obtain the {{index . "component"}} part of the path `{{index . "fullpath"}}` and discard the
rest of the path components returned by `path.Split()`. 

For instance, the {{index . "component"}} part of `{{index . "fullpath"}}` is `{{index
. "output"}}`.

Implement your code in a function `splitPath` with the below signature:

``` go
// splitPath returns the {{index . component}} component of a file path
func splitPath(fullpath, component string) string {
    ...
}
```

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
