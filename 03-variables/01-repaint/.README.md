# "Repaint" a variable to its complementary color

Write a small function, and change the value of the `color` variable from "{{index . "primary"}}" to its complementary: "{{index . "complementary"}}" in the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`. Do not use additional variables, or modify the existing code.
