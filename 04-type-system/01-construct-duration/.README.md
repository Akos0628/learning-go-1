# Construct duration from arguments

Write a small function that accepts two arguments ({{index . "arg1"}}, {{index . "arg2"}}), construct a time instant based on them, where {{index . "arg1"}} is the number of {{index . "type1"}}, while {{index . "arg2"}} is the number of {{index . "type2"}}. The function returns the result as `time.Duration`. Place your code in the `exercise.go` file near tho the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`
