# Filtering data

Write a small function that accepts two arguments: an array of keys and an array of values. The function has to return an array of filtered keys with a length of 20. The filtering applies the following requirements:

- The first ten value is invalid, so they have to be filtered out
- Keys with the i-th index has to be filtered out if the corresponding value (in the `values` array) does not fulfill the following property: `{{ index . "filter"}}`
- If the length of result array would be shorter than 20, then use empty string to fill the remaining indices.

Place your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
