# Warm up

Starting with this exercise, you'll build a game store. In this exercise we create the basic
structs that will hold the game results.

1. Declare the following structs:
   - `item`: `id` (int), `name` (string), `price` (int)
   - `game`: embed the `item`, `genre` (string)

2. Return a game slice using the following data:

| id | name | price  | genre |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{index . "id"}} | {{index . "name"}} | {{index . "price"}} | {{index . "genre"}}
