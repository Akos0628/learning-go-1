# Learning Go: Basic Go exercises

A series of basic Go exercises inspired from the [Go: Bootcamp
Course](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo). Solving all exercises will not make you a Go ninja
but it is enough to get the basics and start to learn the advanced stuff on your own.

## Getting started

Change to the root of the git repo and 

## Write code

Go through the subdirectories, preferably in the same order as the file names, understand the
exercise specified in the README, and insert your solution into `exercise.go` near the
pleaceholder. You can divide your code to as many files as you want but don't forget to add each
file to your git repo.

## Test

At any point in time you can test your solutions as follows.

``` console
make generate
make test
```

## Clean up

Reset all generated files to the default placeholder.

``` console
make clean
```

Also reset the student id: this is required before pushing any modification to the exercises.

``` console
make realclean
```
