# Calculate factorial

Write a small function that returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of {{index . "n"}}.

For instance, the function should return 24 for 4, because 24 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINT: use the [`for` loop](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/1).
