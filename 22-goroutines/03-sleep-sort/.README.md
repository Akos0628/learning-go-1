# Sleep sort

Sleep sort works by starting a separate goroutine for each item to be sorted, where each task sleeps for an interval corresponding to the item's sort key, then emits the item. Items are then collected sequentially in time.

Write a `{{index . "funcName"}}` function that performs a {{index . "dir"}} sleep-sort on the slice of integers received as input. You can assume the input is in the range [1,50] and every item `x` should induce a wait of `x*10` milliseconds if you sort in the forward direction and `500 - x*10` milliseconds if you sort in the reverse direction. This way, the function is guaranteed to terminate under 0.5 second. Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINTS:
- use a separate goroutine per item and a channel to return the result from each goroutine,
- `for` loop variables and closures may interact strangely in Go, remember the GOTCHA from the seminar on loop constructs!
