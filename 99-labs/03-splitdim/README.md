# A silly web app: SplitDim

In this lab we build a Go web app that allows groups of people to keep track of money transfers between themselves and helps clear debs and credits with minimal money transfer. The app is by and large modeled after the excellent [SplitWise)[https://www.splitwise.com] app but it is much dumber so we will call it SplitDim. The below tasks walk you through writing a simple web app with the basic local database and deploying it into Kubernetes; we will gradually extend the app during the next labs to implement the 5 cloud native pillars (recall: scalability, loose coupling, resilience, manageabilty, and observability). Each section is closed with an exercise and a test that you can run to check whether you successfully completed the task.

## A skeleton

SplitWise helps housemates, trips, friends, and family to maintain their money transfers and keep track who owns who. Imagine you are at a trip with your friends, you invite one of your friends for a coffee, they pay the taxi fee for the group, and then another friend calls you back
