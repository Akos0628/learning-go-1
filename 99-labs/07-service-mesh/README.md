# Service mesh

So far, we have gradually improved our toy web app, SplitDim, into a real cloud native microservice application. We moved resource state out from the app into a key-value store data layer, making our app effectively stateless, we added various resilience mechanism to make the communication between the app and the key-value store more robust, and we showed several ways to manage the app without having to modify and redeploy the any Go code. These improvements were greatly supported, and in large parts made possible, by the built-in cloud native features offered by Kubernetes; for instance, Kubernetes lets is specify config files in ConfigMaps and map these easily and declaratively into the app's startup parameters, allow the app to reach the key-value store via a DNS name eliminating the tight coupling that would be created by communicating over a fix IP address, etc. 

In this lab we show that the cloud native support provided by Kubernetes does not stop here: in fact, *many resilience, manageability and observability patterns are readily provided by service meshes* on top of Kubernetes, without us having to write any specific code (in fact, most of the time we must even *remove* cloud native support from our app in order to avoid interfering with the cloud native features implemented in the service mesh). We will demonstrate the use of service meshes using our SplitDim web app and we will also take this occasion to cover the last remaining cloud native pillar: *observability*.

The below tasks let you familiarize yourself with one of the most popular service mesh distributions, Istio. The service mesh concept, however, is much broader than what we have room to cover here, so take this only as a gentle introduction of the basic workings of a service mesh; we encourage you to [make your own research](https://istio.io/latest/docs) to get more info.

## Preliminaries

The service mesh concept emerged from the need to obtain better tools to more efficiently manage modern applications, typically architected as distributed collections of microservices that together perform some concrete business function. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer on top of Kubernetes that can transparently add capabilities like observability, traffic management, and security, without having to add them to your own code. It is the communication between microservices that makes a distributed application possible. Correspondingly, most of the service mesh features address some critical aspect of internal and external *network communications* in Kubernetes, like HTTP request routing, load balancing, failure recovery, rate limiting, access control, encryption, and end-to-end authentication.

Below we use Istio and to demonstrate some of the useful features provided by a modern service mesh. We will use SplitDim to 

At this point, you should have Istio installed in your cluster. If not, go back to the first lab and make sure Istio, the command line config tool called `istioctl`, and the Kubernetes Gateway API are [installed](https://github.com/l7mp/learning-go/blob/master/99-labs/01-setup/README.md#install-istio). Next, we customize Istio to unlock some useful features which are not available in the minimal profile we have used this far.

1. Make sure `istioctl` is available in your shell.

   ```shell
   export ISTIO_DIR=<path-to-istio-root-dir>
   export PATH=${ISTIO_DIR}/bin:${PATH}
   ```
   
   Check that `istioctl` works fine; if yes, you should see some version info dumped by `istioctl` to the console.
   
   ```shell
   istioctl version
   ```
   
   You can enable `istioctl` bash autocompletion in the current shell using the below
   
   ```shell
   source <(istioctl completion bash)
   ```

2. Reconfigure Istio with the `demo` profile. This will enable Prometheus for metric collection, Jaeger for tracing, Kiali for monitoring the service mesh, etc.

   ```shell
   istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
   ```
   
   > **Note**
   >
   > It make take a while until all Istio components come up online. Meanwhile, some Istio features may not be available. Watch the pod statuses in the `istio-system` namespace to test whether everything works fine: `kubectl get pods -n istio-system -o wide`.

3. Enable tracing. In particular, the below configuration will instruct Istio to collect traces for every 2nd HTTP request in Jaeger.

   ``` bash
   istioctl install -y -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
   kind: IstioOperator
   spec:
     meshConfig:
       enableTracing: true
       defaultConfig:
         tracing:
           sampling: 50
   EOF
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > Do not use this in production: tracing has substantial resource requirements that may easily overwhelm your cluster.

4. Enable Istio in the `default` namespace. This amounts to switching Istio *sidecar injection* on, which means that Istio will automatically process the traffic of each pod in the `default` namespace to enforce the traffic management policies configured in Istio.

   ```shell
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > The above will affect only newly created pods in the namespace but *does not* restart any workload already running. You have to manually restart your Deployments and StatefulSets to enable Istio to control them.

To actually use Istio on a real workload, we will of course use our handy SplitDim app. Deploy SplitDim with the key-value store backend; if it already runs, make sure to restart it (as well as the key-value store) in order for Istio to take effect. At the end your pod listing should show something like the below:

```shell
kubectl get pod 
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kvstore-0                   2/2     Running   0          84s
splitdim-58c48cf87b-wgdfp   2/2     Running   0          89s
```

What is important here is the readiness status: for instance the `READY` column output `2/2` for the `splitdim` pod shows that the pod is running *two* containers, one is of course `splitdim` itself and the other is a *sidecar proxy* injected by Istio to process the pod's ingress/egress traffic.

> **Note**
>
> You may see different output if you use, e.g., [Istio Ambient Mesh](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/ambient/getting-started).

Add some initial data to the app:

```shell
export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service splitdim -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export EXTERNAL_PORT=80
curl http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/reset
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"sender":"a","receiver":"b","amount":2}' http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/transfer
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"sender":"b","receiver":"c","amount":1}' http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/transfer
```

## Observability

One of the most useful features of a service mesh is that it provided deep insight into the actual communication patterns between microservices: you can see which service (that is, Kubernetes Service!) exchanges traffic with which other services, the instantaneous HTTP request rate and response time(!), HTTP status codes (so you can spot frequent HTTP failure statuses like 404 or 500), you can even trace client calls through the mesh. The low level metrics are collected by [Prometheus](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/querying-metrics), which can then be visualized in fancy dashboards using [Grafana](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/using-istio-dashboard). However, by far the most useful (and visually appealing!) observability tool provided by Istio is [Kiali](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/kiali). 

Instead of going into the details of the monitoring goodies what Kiali provided, it is best if you experience it firsthand. First, generate some background traffic: the below will query the `/api/clear` API endpoint 5 times per second and dump the output to the console.

``` bash
watch -n .2 curl -o /dev/null -s http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/clear
```

Now we are ready to launch Kiali:

``` bash
bin/istioctl dashboard kiali
```

Some help:
- The *Overview* panel gives some overall statistics about the cluster, including the CPU usage of Istio itself, total external traffic of your workloads, etc.
- The *Graphs* provides several visual representations of the microservice graph. Use the dropdowns at the top to select a namespace to monitor, the types of traffic to watch (HTTP should be enough for now), the visualization type (we recommend the *Workload graph* view), and the metrics to be displayed (enable the "95-th percentile response time" and the "traffic rate" metrics, and you may want to remove the "Service nodes" to get a per-pod view of your microservice graph). The right-hand sidebar shows the total traffic characteristics, including the failure rate of each workload. By default, metrics are shown for the last 1 minute and update every 10 secs: you can override this using the dropdowns in the upper right corner. Click to any of the nodes: you should see the details for that pod/service.
- The *Applications*, *Workloads* and *Services* panels give different views of your Kubernetes resources that define your workload. Click into any of the workload items: you should see an overview of the item, traffic aggregates, live inbound traffic charts, and even traces showing the response times during the last couple of seconds.

> **Note**
>
> You won't see any meaningful output unless there is actual traffic in the cluster. This is because Istio traces out the service graph passively from live traffic, so if there is no traffic, no output.

## Ingress gateway

Next, you will see how to expose a Kubernetes service to external clients in a controlled and monitored way using Istio *ingress gateways*. This allows to route client requests based on request headers or other attributes to different microservices, filter incoming traffic, terminate TLS encryption contexts, etc. 

Below, we will expose `splitdim` using the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io).

1. Since Istio ingress gateways create and manage their own LoadBalancer services, we will not need the LoadBalancer service that we created ourselves. Use the below to change the Service type of the `splitdim` Service from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP`, which will remove the external IP address from the service (again, Istio will create its own one).

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: splitdim
     labels:
       app: splitdim
   spec:
     selector:
       app: splitdim
     ports:
     - name: "http-splitdim"
       port: 80
       targetPort: 8080
       protocol: TCP
     type: ClusterIP
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an Gateway called `splitdim` that will listen on port 80 for HTTP connections:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: splitdim
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: istio
     listeners:
       - name: http-splitdim
         port: 80
         protocol: HTTP
   EOF
   ```

3. Create a HTTP route that will be attached to the above Gateway and send all received HTTP requests to a random pod of the `splitdim` Service.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: splitdim
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: splitdim
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: splitdim
             port: 80
   EOF
   ```

If all goes well, Istio should have created a LoadBalancer service called `splitdim-istio` for the Gateway and expose it to external clients. 

```shell
kubectl get svc splitdim-istio 
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                        AGE
splitdim-istio   LoadBalancer   10.110.216.108   10.110.216.108   15021:31840/TCP,80:30726/TCP   21m
```

From now on, we will use this Service to reach our application: let's make sure we remember the external IP and port.

```shell
export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service splitdim-istio -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export EXTERNAL_PORT=80
```

Make some quick tests to see if everything goes fine. You can also re-enable the little traffic generator and take a look and the service graphs in Kiali: this time it should show detailed metrics from the new ingress Gateway as well.

> ✅ **Check**
> 
> Test your Kubernetes deployment. If all goes well, you should see the output `PASS`.
> ``` sh
> cd 99-labs/code/splitdim
> export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service splitdim-istio -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
> export EXTERNAL_PORT=80
> go test ./... --tags=httphandler,api,localconstructor,reset,transfer,accounts,clear -v -count 1
> PASS
> ```

## Traffic management

One of the most powerful features of Istio is that it provides programmatic access to the way Kubernetes forwards HTTP requests/responses between pods. This feature set is collectively called *traffic management*. Examples are:
- *Request routing*: route HTTP requests based on HTTP host field, header fields, cookies, to multiple versions of a microservice, rewrite HTTP request and response headers, etc.
- *Load balancing:* choose precisely how to distribute requests across service pods.
- *Resilience*: the usual assortment of resilience patterns, like retry/timeout, circuit breaking, rate limiting, etc., provided by Istio *automatically* to your microservices, without you having to code anything in your code.
- *Fault injection*: randomly inject HTTP faults to test the resiliency of an application.
- *Traffic shifting, canary deployments and A/B testing*: migrate traffic from an old to new version of a service.
- *Traffic mirroring*: replicate and route a subset of your traffic from the cluster to an external service for, say, lawful interception, recording or debugging.

Below we highlight a couple of simple examples for Istio traffic management; we encourage you to discover and try all tutorials from the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management).

### Request routing

Suppose that we have developed a new version of our SplitDim app and now we want to test it out *inside* a real, production workload. To minimize the blast radius, we want to route only a subset of API requests to the new version, say, we may want to send the HTTP requests that contain the HTTP header `user:test` to the new software version, let's call that `splitdim-2`, and everything else should go to the legacy code running in the `splitdim` service. We, however, will let the two versions to use the same key-value store service (`kvstore`). Then, the DevOps engineer could simply test out the new version by setting the HTTP header `user:test` on the test requests, without interfering with the normal traffic.

Here is how to realize this setup in Istio:

1. We will use the same SplitDim code for "simulating" the old and a new versions for simplicity (but feel free to build a separate image and add some changes if you want), but the name will be `splitdim-2`. So add a new `splitdim-2` Deployment and Service as a perfect copy of the Kubernetes manifest we used to deploy `splitdim`, but make sure to rename all `splitdim` references to `splitdim-2` (including labels!). 

   If all goes well, listing your pods and services should show something like the below:
   ```shell
   kubectl get pod,deploy,svc 
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   pod/kvstore-0                         2/2     Running   2          21h
   pod/splitdim-2-645c5d969b-n7rcf       2/2     Running   0          75m
   pod/splitdim-7bd49f7b94-vvhc2         2/2     Running   0          75m
   
   NAME                             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   deployment.apps/splitdim         1/1     1            1           2d2h
   deployment.apps/splitdim-2       1/1     1            1           141m
   
   NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                        AGE
   service/kubernetes       ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>           443/TCP                        12d
   service/kvstore          ClusterIP      None             <none>           8081/TCP                       21h
   service/splitdim         ClusterIP      10.100.168.92    <none>           80/TCP                         20h
   service/splitdim-2       ClusterIP      10.97.175.181    <none>           80/TCP                         141m
   ```

2. Reconfigure the HTTPRoute that we used to route requests from the Gateway to the `splitdim` service.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: splitdim
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: splitdim
     rules:
       - matches:
           - headers:
               - name: user
                 value: test
         backendRefs:
           - name: splitdim-2
             port: 80
       - backendRefs:
           - name: splitdim
             port: 80
   ```

   The idea is that we have two routing rules: the first one matches on the HTTP header field called `user` and if the value is `test` then routes the request to the `splitdim-2` service running the "new" software version, and the second rule applies to everything else (since it comes without an actual `matches` clause) and forwards everything to the `splitdim` service running the "old" version.
   
3. Start some background traffic. 

   ```shell
   while [ true ]; do \
       curl -s http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/clear; \
       curl -s --header "user:test" http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:${EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/clear; \
       sleep 0.2; \
   done
   ```
   
   The above will send roughly 4-5 requests per second to both the new version (using the command line `curl --header "user:test"` to add the header required for sending test traffic) and the old one.
   
If all goes well, Kiali should show an output like the below (after a while).

![Traffic management: Gateway.](/99-labs/fig/kiali-gateway.png)

### Fault injection

We have already seen how useful handy Istio's fault injection can be for testing the resilience of our web app. For instance, the below will add a policy to fail every 10th requests to the `/api/list` API endpoint of the key-value store, which, recall, is used by the web app to clear the balances:

``` yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata: { name: kvstore-500 }
spec:
  hosts: [ kvstore ]
  http:
    # requests to the "/api/clear" path will return 500 status every 10th time
    - match: [ uri: { exact: "/api/list" } ]
      fault: { abort: { httpStatus: 500, percentage: { value: 10 } } }
      route: [ destination: { host: kvstore } ]
    # default route: everything that is not a "put" ("list" and "get")
    - route: [ destination: { host: kvstore } ]
```

If all goes well, Kiali should show that the error rate of our service has increased to about 10%. This real-time visibility into the health of a microservice application is one of the most powerful features provided by a service mesh.

![Service graph from an unhealthy cluster.](/99-labs/fig/kiali-unhealthy.png)

## Security

So far, all our traffic sent between the microservices have been unencrypted, possibly revealing sensitive data to the cloud provider. Istio allows to encrypt all this traffic by adding a single policy, making it possible for third parties to eavesdrop on our communication.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata: { name: default }
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

Unfortunately, that is all that we could cover from the intriguing (and rapidly evolving) world of service meshes. If interested, we recommend the fantastic [documentation of Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs), which provides much more information with use cases, tutorials and complete command references.
