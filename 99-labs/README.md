# Labs

The course consists of labs that give you hands-on experience on both
developing and deploying cloud-native apps in Go. During the labs you
will learn how to build, containerize, and deploy your Go programs in
the cloud. We will mostly work with Kubernetes, while last labs focus
on service meshes.
