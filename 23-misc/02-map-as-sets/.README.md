# Search

Write a function that reads the below text and returns `true` or `false` if "{{index . "word"}}" appears in the text *more than once*, without respect to letter case (i.e., the each of words `Hello`, `heLLo`, and `HELlo` match for the search strings `HELLO` and `hello`).

> "{{index . "text"}}"

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINT: use a `map[string]int` to remember the number of times a particular word is found while iterating through the text word by word.
