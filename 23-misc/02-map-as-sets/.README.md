# Search

Write a function that reads the below text and returns `true` or `false` if "{{index . "word"}}" appears in the text without respect to letter case (i.e., your function should return `true` for the string "Hello world" for any the search strings `Hello`, `HELLO`, and `hello`).

> "{{index . "text"}}"

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINT: use a `map[string]bool` to remember the words already found in the text while iterating through it word by word.
